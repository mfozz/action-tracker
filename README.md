Action Tracker
=======

**Why do I need this module?**  
-----------
Are you tired of forgetting which actions you've taken during a round? As a DM, are you tired of mentally keeping track of all the actions every player made during a round PLUS all the actions your baddies made? As a player, do you just forget whether you've taken that bonus action? Then, this is the module for you.  

This module D&D 5e module adds action tracking buttons to the token HUD and the combat tracker. Click the buttons in either location to signal that you've taken a specific action.


**Feature List**

- **Combat Tracker:** The buttons sync between the HUD and the Tracker.

Does this module conflict with any others?
- I haven't noticed any conflicts yet, and I usually run 100+ modules and haven't seen a conflict yet. However, modules that modify the token HUD or the combat tracker might conflict.
