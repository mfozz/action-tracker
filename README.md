Action Tracker
=======

**Why do I need this module?**  
-----------
Are you tired of forgetting which actions you've taken during a round? As a DM, are you tired of mentally keeping track of all the actions every player made during a round PLUS all the actions your baddies made? Then, this is the module for you.  

This D&D 5e module adds action-tracking buttons to the token HUD and the combat tracker. Click the buttons in either location to signal that you've taken a specific action.


**Feature List**  
-----------
- **Tracker Buttons:** Click the icons/buttons in the token HUD to track the actions you've taken. 
- **Combat Tracker:** The buttons sync between the HUD and the Tracker.
- **Number of Action Icons:** Choose the number of buttons between 3-5.
- **Customization:** Customize when the action reset happens, the look and sound of the icons, and whether they appear in the combat tracker.




**Additional Development Notes (FAQ)**
-----------
Does this module conflict with any others?
- I usually run 100+ modules and haven't seen a conflict yet. However, modules that modify the token HUD or the combat tracker might conflict.
